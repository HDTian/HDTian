ðŸ‘‹ Hi

I am working on **causal inference** âˆ© **statistics or machine learning** for epidemiology

### Selected Open Source Code and Projects:
- [DRMR](https://github.com/HDTian/DRMR.com) if the causal effect can be nonlinear
- [RFQT](https://github.com/HDTian/RFQT.com) if the causal effect can be nonlinear or heterogeneous
- [TVMR](https://github.com/HDTian/TVMR.com) if the causal effect can be time-varying

Code issues email me directly, most of them will be solved within 2 working days

Methodological inquiries and collaboration are very welcome!
