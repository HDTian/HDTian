ðŸ‘‹ Hi

I am working on **causal inference** âˆ© **stats/ML** for genetic epidemiology

### Selected Open Source Code and Projects:
- [DRMR](https://github.com/HDTian/DRMR) for stratified IV analysis
- [RFQT](https://github.com/HDTian/RFQT) for effect heterogneiety analysis
- [TVMR](https://github.com/HDTian/TVMR) for time-varying IV analysis
- [SSS](https://github.com/HDTian/SSS) for nonlinear IV analysis

Email code issues to me directlyâ€”I aim to resolve most within two working days.

Let me know if any guidance seems unclear.
