ðŸ‘‹ Hi

I am working on **causal inference** âˆ© **statistics or machine learning** for genetic epidemiology

### Selected Open Source Code and Projects:
- [DRMR](https://github.com/HDTian/DRMR) if the causal effect can be nonlinear
- [RFQT](https://github.com/HDTian/RFQT) if the causal effect can be nonlinear or heterogeneous
- [TVMR](https://github.com/HDTian/TVMR) if the causal effect can be time-varying

Email code issues to me directly - most will be solved within 2 working days

Let me know if you feel any guidance is not clear 

Methodological inquiries and collaboration are very welcome
